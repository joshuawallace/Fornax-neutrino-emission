These data have been generated using FORNAX.  See Wallace, Burrows,
and Dolence (arxiv:1512.01338) for details.

There are two types of files available. At this directory level are
files that provide the values for the energy bins of each neutrino type.
These are of the form *_energy_bins.txt. The first commented line of each 
file has listed the minimum and maximum energies used in the energy groups,
followed by two columns of data.  The first column is the energy group bin 
center, and the second column is the energy group bin width.  There are 
40 energy groups There are three of these files, one for each neutrino type:

nue - electron neutrinos
nua - anti-electron neutrinos
nux - the "nu_x" neutrinos: muon and tau neutrions and their antiparticles

The other file type that is available is in the next level of directories.  
There are five of these directories, one for each progenitor model. Within 
each directory are the spectra data for each neutrino type for the 
corresponding progenitor model.  Each file corresponds to a specific time 
in the simulation, as can be seen in the file names.

'nu_spectra.t_002.dat'  is a file containing spectral data at a time 2 ms
after the time of maximum energy luminosity.

'nu_spectra.t_n029.dat'  is a file containing spectral data at a time 29 ms
*before* the time of maximum energy luminosity.  The 'n' prior to the number 
in the file name stands for 'negative'.

There are three columns in each file, corresponding to data for each neutrino 
type: electron, anti-electron, and "nu_x" neutrinos, in that order.  There 
are 40 rows of data, corresponding to the 40 energy groups.  The data are 
the energy luminosity (not flux) for the given neutrino type in the 
given energy bin.

***Note: these data are integrated over each bin, i.e., they are not
spectral densities.*** The units are in 10^51 erg/s
